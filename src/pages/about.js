            churches in the U.S. Therefore we have accepted the responsibility
            to care for 20,000 of the 400,000 children per year. The revival of
            compassion in our fellowship is laying the groundwork to bring
            redemption to broken children and families.

            We have a beautiful array of rural, urban, and suburban churches
            that are small, medium, and large in size. Not every church can find
            families to foster or adopt children, but every church can do
            something. Here are four areas of involvement:

Two of the top issues in foster care are:
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
    There are not enough families to foster or adopt
    </li>
    <li>
    50% of foster families quit after the first year, and 
another 50% quit after the second year.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Churches are positioned to solve both of these 
problems. We have families and we have support 
systems within the church.
</p>

<p>
The AG Foster Care Network is a group of 
organizations that exist to serve and support you, 
the church.
